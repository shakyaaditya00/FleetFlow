# 🖥️ System Modules

---

## 1️⃣ Login & Authentication

**Purpose:** Secure system access.

**Features:**

* Email & Password login
* Forgot password flow
* Role-based authorization
* Protected routes

---

## 2️⃣ Command Center Dashboard

**Purpose:** Fleet oversight at a glance.

**Key KPIs:**

* Active Fleet — Vehicles currently on trips
* Maintenance Alerts — Vehicles in service
* Utilization Rate — Assigned vs idle fleet %
* Pending Cargo — Unassigned shipments

**Filters:**

* Vehicle type (Truck / Van / Bike)
* Status
* Region

---

## 3️⃣ Vehicle Registry (Asset Management)

**Purpose:** Manage fleet assets.

**CRUD Data Fields:**

* Vehicle Name / Model
* License Plate (Unique ID)
* Max Load Capacity
* Odometer Reading

**Business Logic:**

* “Out of Service” toggle retires vehicles from operations

---

## 4️⃣ Trip Dispatcher & Management

**Purpose:** Goods transportation workflow.

**Features:**

* Trip creation form
* Assign available driver + vehicle
* Cargo validation rule
* Trip lifecycle tracking

**Validation Rule:**

```
Cargo Weight ≤ Vehicle Max Capacity
```

**Trip Status Flow:**

Draft → Dispatched → Completed → Cancelled

---

## 5️⃣ Maintenance & Service Logs

**Purpose:** Preventative & reactive servicing.

**Automation Logic:**

* Adding service log → Vehicle status = “In Shop”
* Vehicle removed from dispatcher pool
* Restored after service completion

---

## 6️⃣ Expense & Fuel Logging

**Purpose:** Track operational spending.

**Data Points:**

* Fuel liters
* Fuel cost
* Date
* Vehicle ID

**Auto-Calculation:**

```
Total Operational Cost = Fuel + Maintenance
```

Per vehicle tracking enabled.

---

## 7️⃣ Driver Performance & Safety Profiles

**Purpose:** Compliance & HR management.

**Compliance Rules:**

* License expiry tracking
* Expired license → Assignment blocked

**Performance Metrics:**

* Trip completion rate
* Safety score

**Driver Status:**

* On Duty
* Off Duty
* Suspended

---

## 8️⃣ Operational Analytics & Reports

**Purpose:** Data-driven insights.

**Metrics:**

* Fuel Efficiency → km/L
* Vehicle ROI:

```
ROI = (Revenue − (Maintenance + Fuel)) / Acquisition Cost
```

**Exports:**

* CSV reports
* PDF financial audits
* Payroll summaries

---

# 🔄 Workflow Logic Summary

### 1. Vehicle Intake

Add **Van-05** (500kg capacity)
Status → Available

### 2. Driver Compliance

Add driver **Alex**
System validates license category

### 3. Dispatching

Assign Alex → Van-05 → 450kg load

Validation:

```
450 < 500 → PASS
```

Status → On Trip

### 4. Trip Completion

Driver marks trip complete
Updates odometer

Status → Available

### 5. Maintenance Logging

Manager logs oil change

Auto-update:

```
Status → In Shop
```

Vehicle hidden from dispatcher

### 6. Analytics Update

Fuel logs update cost-per-km metrics
